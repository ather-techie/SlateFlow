# SlateFlow

SlateFlow is a self-hosted, single-container project management platform for agile teams. It pairs a drag-and-drop Kanban board with the full Hierarchy (Project → Sprint → Epic → Feature → Story → Task), sprint planning with burndown, a per-sprint Retrospective Board, a calendar that blends sprints/epics/features with team holidays, events, and vacations, a Gantt-style roadmap, velocity / cycle-time / capacity reports, test case management, real-time collaboration over Server-Sent Events, multi-user RBAC at global / project / epic level, and AI card summarisation across Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Ollama. SQLite + Hono + React in a single Docker image — no external services required.

## Features

- **Dashboard** — project overview with stats (open cards, active sprints) and a cross-project activity feed
- **Kanban board** — swim lanes and cards with full drag-and-drop reordering; manage lanes inline
- **Lane presets** — pick a workflow template (e.g. Scrum, Kanban) when creating a project, or define custom lanes
- **Sprint management** — create, activate, and complete sprints; burndown charts per sprint
- **Backlog** — full CRUD on unassigned cards (create, click-to-edit via modal, delete); cards grouped by swim lane; move to any sprint in one click
- **Story tasks** — sub-items on any story card; to-do / in-progress / done toggle with an inline progress bar in the card modal
- **Card attachments** — upload files and images directly to story cards; preview images inline; download or delete attachments (gated by `FEATURE_CARD_ATTACHMENTS`)
- **Due dates** — set due dates on cards and tasks; hourly background reminders for upcoming or overdue items; email notifications for assigned users
- **Drag-and-drop** — powered by `@dnd-kit` with pointer sensor support
- **Activity log** — automatic `create`, `update`, and `move` events per card
- **Test management** — attach test cases to cards; group into test suites; record pass/fail/blocked runs; track status with a per-card summary bar
- **Labels & comments** — project-scoped colored labels; threaded comments with `@mention` support
- **Notifications** — in-app bell with unread count badge; real-time SSE delivery via Server-Sent Events; email notifications for mentions, assignments, and due date reminders (SMTP-based, per-user opt-out preference); triggered by `@mention` in comments, story assignment, and due dates
- **Multi-user with RBAC** — JWT auth (httpOnly cookie); three role layers: global (`super_admin` / `global_reader`), project (`project_admin` / `contributor` / `reader`), and epic (`epic_admin` / `contributor` / `reader`); project admins have a dedicated `/projects/:id/admin` panel (Members, Settings, Lanes) without needing super_admin
- **Flexible login methods** — email/password, Google OAuth, and GitHub OAuth, each independently toggleable via feature flags (`FEATURE_AUTH_PASSWORD`, `FEATURE_AUTH_GOOGLE`, `FEATURE_AUTH_GITHUB`); identities stored in a `user_identities` table that's ready for SSO
- **Real-time updates** — Server-Sent Events stream board mutations and notifications to every connected client
- **AI features** — gated by `FEATURE_AI=true`; provider-agnostic across Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Ollama:
  - *Card summarisation* — generates a 2–3 sentence summary from a story's title and description
  - *Story generation from features* — generates 3–7 user story outlines from a feature's title and description (gated by `FEATURE_AUTO_STORY_GENERATION_AI`)
  - *Test case generation* — generates 3–5 test cases from a story's title and description (gated by `FEATURE_AUTO_TEST_CASE_GENERATION_AI`)
  - *Natural-language work-item creation* — type a sentence to create an epic, feature, story, task, project, sprint, or calendar event; AI returns an editable preview before confirming; available on the Board, Epics, Sprints, Calendar, and Dashboard pages
- **Retrospective Board** — per-sprint reflection with three fixed columns (Went well / To improve / Action items) and live drag-and-drop reorder; gated by `FEATURE_RETROSPECTIVE=true`
- **Calendar** — month view of sprints, epics, and features alongside super-admin-managed global holidays, project events, and per-user vacations; holidays support optional country and state/province tagging; calendar view lets users filter by country; gated by `FEATURE_CALENDAR=true`
- **GitHub & GitLab integration** — attach PR, MR, or commit links to any story card; gated by `FEATURE_GITHUB_INTEGRATION` / `FEATURE_GITLAB_INTEGRATION`; webhook receivers (`POST /webhooks/github`, `POST /webhooks/gitlab`) automatically move linked cards to the done lane when a PR/MR is merged; optional PAT for fetching titles on private repos
- **Self-host** — single Docker container, SQLite database on a named volume; no external services required

### Planning & Visibility
- **Roadmap / timeline view** — Gantt-style view across Epics and Features with date ranges
- **Story dependencies** — "blocks / blocked by" relationships between stories
- **User skills** — app-level and project-level skill tags on team members for resource planning
- **Capacity planning** — assignee workload view per sprint with committed capacity (story points per person) vs. actual; visual indicators for over-allocation
- **User profiles** — extended profile fields including work/home location (country, state, city), timezone, job title, department, phone, gender, and reporting manager for team context and resource planning

### Reporting
- **Velocity chart** — story points completed per sprint, trend over time, with average velocity calculation; velocity snapshots for completed sprints
- **Cycle time / lead time** — how long cards spend in each lane
- **Capacity report** — per-assignee workload with team skills and committed capacity
- **CSV export** — backlog, sprint report, or full project snapshot as CSV

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+ 

Node : https://nodejs.org/en/download/archive/v20.20.1

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/slateflow.git
cd slateflow
npm install
npm run dev
```

| URL | What |
|-----|------|
| http://localhost:5173 | Kanban board (React + Vite HMR) |
| http://localhost:3000 | REST API (Hono) |
| http://localhost:3000/api/docs | OpenAPI / Swagger documentation |
| http://localhost:3000/health | Health check endpoint |

The SQLite database (`server/slateflow.db`) is created and seeded with a demo project on first boot.

## Docker Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose

```bash
# Copy and edit env vars (required if you want OAuth, AI, or to change SECRET/PORT).
# The dev server reads this file at startup; Docker passes through anything set
# here via docker-compose.yml.
cp .env.example .env

# Build and start on port 3000
docker-compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3000. The database is stored in the `slateflow-data` Docker volume and survives container restarts.

```bash
docker-compose down          # stop
docker-compose build         # rebuild after source changes
```

If port 3000 is already in use, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#freeing-port-3000) for PowerShell and Bash recipes to free it.
